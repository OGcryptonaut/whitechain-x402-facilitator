# Whitechain mainnet

Nothing in the facilitator is testnet-only. This page is the checklist for serving Whitechain mainnet, and what is still unknown until Whitechain publishes the details.

## What is needed

| Item | Status | Where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet chain id | published by Whitechain at mainnet launch of the OP Stack L2 | `NETWORKS[].id` as `eip155:<id>` |
| Public RPC and explorer URLs | published with the chain id | `NETWORKS[].rpc`, `NETWORKS[].explorer` |
| An EIP-3009 settlement token | USDC.e bridged through the Whitechain Portal (Circle FiatToken interface, 6 decimals) | merchants' `price.asset`; optionally `NETWORKS[].assets` allowlist |
| The token's EIP-712 domain | read `eip712Domain()` or `name()` / `version()` on the deployed contract; FiatToken v2 is `USD Coin` / `2` | merchants' `price.extra` |
| WBT for gas | buy on WhiteBIT or bridge via the Portal | the signer wallet |
| x402 Permit2 proxies (optional) | not deployed yet; see below | enables Permit2 `exact` and `upto` for any ERC-20 |

## Configuration

```sh
NETWORKS='[
  { "id": "eip155:1874", "name": "Whitechain Sepolia",
    "rpc": "https://rpc.testnet.whitechain.io", "explorer": "https://explorer.testnet.whitechain.io", "testnet": true },
  { "id": "eip155:<MAINNET_CHAIN_ID>", "name": "Whitechain",
    "rpc": "https://<mainnet-rpc>", "explorer": "https://<mainnet-explorer>", "testnet": false,
    "assets": ["0xUSDCe_ADDRESS"],
    "confirmationTimeoutMs": 45000 }
]'
GAS_BUDGET_GLOBAL_DAILY=0.5
GAS_BUDGET_PER_PAYTO_DAILY=0.05
REQUIRE_API_KEY=false
FEE_MODE=off
```

Recommendations that differ from testnet:

- **Allowlist assets** on mainnet. On testnet any EIP-3009 token is accepted; on mainnet restrict to tokens you are willing to sponsor so nobody can make you pay gas for transfers of a worthless token.
- **Budget in real money.** Set the daily budgets to what you would accept losing to abuse in a day, and watch `metrics.policy.gasBudgetExceeded` before raising them.
- **Keys for volume.** Keep the keyless path open with low limits for discovery, and hand out API keys with dedicated budgets to merchants you have a relationship with. `REQUIRE_API_KEY=true` turns the service into an allowlisted facilitator, which also removes the only way a stranger can cost you gas (a token that lies to the simulation).
- **Size the RPC ceiling.** `RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL_PER_WINDOW` (default 1,200 calls per minute, each fanning out into several JSON-RPC requests) should match what your RPC plan allows; a dedicated endpoint with a key in its URL is fine, the URL is never logged or returned.
- **Separate signer per environment.** Never share the testnet signer key with mainnet.

## Charging for sponsorship

The `exact` scheme moves funds payer to payTo directly, so a facilitator cannot take a cut on chain. What it can do is decide whether to sponsor and account for what it is owed:

- `FEE_MODE=off` (default): sponsor everything, record nothing.
- `FEE_MODE=accrue` with `FEE_BPS` (basis points of the payment amount) and/or `FEE_FLAT_ATOMIC` (in the payment token's atomic units): sponsor everything and accrue `flat + amount * bps / 10000` per successful settlement, grouped by API key (or `payTo` when no key), visible under `fees.accrued` in `/metrics`. Bill merchants from that, or replace `FeePolicy` in `src/policy/fee.ts` with one that calls your billing system and refuses (`fee_policy_rejected`) when an account is overdue.

Other models that fit the hook without protocol changes: a sponsor (for example an ecosystem fund) covering gas for everyone; per-merchant prepaid gas budgets expressed as API keys with `dailyGasBudget`; or a resource server that adds its own fee to the price it asks the agent for.

## Permit2 and `upto`

Uniswap Permit2 is deployed on Whitechain Sepolia at `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3`, and the Arachnid deterministic deployer at `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C` exists there too. The x402 Permit2 proxy contracts (`x402ExactPermit2Proxy`, `x402UptoPermit2Proxy`) are **not** deployed on Whitechain. Their canonical addresses (`0x402085c248EeA27D92E8b30b2C58ed07f9E20001` and `0x4020A4f3b7b90ccA423B9fabCc0CE57C6C240002`) come from `CREATE2` through that deployer with the init code and salt published in the x402 repository. `scripts/data/*.hex` vendors that init code, `npm run permit2:check` asserts its hashes and the resulting addresses and reports what exists on the network, and `tsx scripts/deploy-permit2-proxies.ts --broadcast` (with `RPC_URL` and a `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` holding a little gas) deploys the missing ones. The addresses are reproducible on Whitechain Sepolia; the deployment is a manual, reviewed step.

Once the proxies exist on a network (deployed by the x402 Foundation, Whitechain, or anyone reproducing them through the deployer), the facilitator registers Permit2-based `exact` and `upto` on that network automatically at the next probe (`PROXY_PROBE_MINUTES`), and `/supported` advertises them. That unlocks any ERC-20 (one-time Permit2 approval by the payer) and the `upto` scheme (authorize a maximum, settle what was used), which suits metered APIs such as LLM inference.

Do not run the deployment script against a public network from this repository's CI or a shared machine; it is a one-off, deliberately manual step that needs a funded key and a review of the init code against the x402 release it came from.

## Checklist before announcing mainnet

- [ ] `NETWORKS` entry added with the published chain id; `npm run permit2:check` and `GET /health` show `rpcOk: true`.
- [ ] USDC.e address and EIP-712 domain verified against the deployed contract; documented in README's token table.
- [ ] Signer funded; `settleRunway` comfortably above a day of expected settles; alerting on `/health` in place.
- [ ] `npm run smoke:sepolia`-style end-to-end run on mainnet with a real agent and merchant, transaction linked in the release notes.
- [ ] Budgets, limits and (if any) fee mode decided and written into CHANGELOG.
- [ ] Denylist refreshed and scheduled.
- [ ] Site and README updated: mainnet row in the networks table, `upto` status, facilitator URL.
